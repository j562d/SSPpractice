				<h2 class="middle">Official Rules</h2>
					<p>
					Besides many variations around the world, the "Swap2" rule (based on "swap" from Renju) is currently adapted in tournaments among professional players. The first player places 3 stones (2 black 1 white, if black goes first) on the board, the second player has the choice to take black/white or to place 2 more stones to change the shape and let the first player choose color.[3] This is essentially a slightly more elaborate pie rule.
					</p>
					<p>
					Swap2 solved the low complexity problem[4] and makes the game fairer. Like other rules and variations, 100% fairness can be reached by playing two alternating games for each point.
				</p>

				<h2>Variations</h2>
					<p>
						Black (the player who makes the first move) was long known to have a big advantage, even before L. Victor Allis proved that black could force a win (see below). So a number of variations are played with extra rules that aimed to reduce black's advantage.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Standard gomoku requires a row of "exactly" five stones for a win: rows of six or more, called overlines, do not count.
						</li>
						<li>Free-style gomoku requires a row of five or more stones for a win.
						</li>
					</ul>

				<h3>Caro</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>In Caro (also called Gomoku+, popular among Vietnamese), the winner must have an unbroken row of five stones and this row must not be blocked at both ends. This rule makes Gomoku more flexible and provides more power for White to defend
						</li>
					</ul>
				<h3>Omok</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Omok is played the same as Standard Gomoku; however, it is played on a 19×19 board and does not include the rule of three and three. The overlines rules still apply.
						/li>
					</ul>

				<h3>Optional("house")rules</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>The rule of three and three bans a move that simultaneously forms two open rows of three stones (rows not blocked by an opponent's stone at either end).
						</li>
						<li>The rule of four and four bans a move that simultaneously forms two rows of four stones (open or not).
						</li>
						<li>
						Alternatively, a handicap may be given such that after the first "three and three" play has been made, the opposing player may place two stones as their next turn. These stones must block an opponent's row of three.
						</li>
						<li>Efforts to improve fairness by reducing first-move advantage include the rule of swap, generalizable as "swap-(x,y,z)" and characterizable as a partially compounded and partially iterated version of the pie rule ("one person slices; the other chooses"): One player places on the board x stones of the first-moving color and a lesser number y stones of the second-moving color ("slicing" in the pie metaphor); the other player is entitled to choose between a) playing from the starting position, in which case the selecting player is also entitled to choose which color to play, and b) placing z (usually [(x - y) + 1]) more stones on the board at locations of that player's choice ("reslicing" in the pie metaphor, with limitations created by the board's existing setup akin to limitations arising from the existing slices in the pie), in which case the former player is entitled to choose which color side to play.
						</li>
					</ul>	
				<h3>Specific variations</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Renju is played on a 15×15 board, with the rules of three and three, four and four, and overlines applied to Black only and with opening rules, some of which are following the swap pattern.
						</li>
						<li>Ninuki-renju or Wu is a variant which adds capturing to the game; it was published in the USA in a slightly simplified form under the name Pente.
						</li>
					</ul>
				<h3>Theoretical generalizations</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>m,n,k-games are a generalization of gomoku to a board with m×n intersections, and k in a row needed to win.
						</li>
						<li>Connect(m,n,k,p,q) games are another generalization of gomoku to a board with m×n intersections, k in a row needed to win, p stones for each player to place, and q stones for the first player to place for the first move only. Each player may play only at the lowest unoccupied place in a column. Connect(m,n,6,2,1) is the most interesting one and is called Connect6.[according to whom?]
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>This game on the 15×15 board is adapted from the paper "Go-Moku and Threat-Space Search".[7]
					</p>
					<p>
					The opening moves show clearly black's advantage. An open row of three (one that is not blocked by an opponent's stone at either end) has to be blocked immediately, or countered with a threat elsewhere on the board. If not blocked or countered, the open row of three will be extended to an open row of four, which threatens to win in two ways.
					</p>
					<p>
					White has to block open rows of three at moves 10, 14, 16 and 20, but black only has to do so at move 9. Move 20 is a blunder for white (it should have been played next to black 19). Black can now force a win against any defence by white, starting with move 21.

					<p>
					Second game (continuation from first game)There are two forcing sequences for black, depending on whether white 22 is played next to black 15 or black 21. The diagram on the right shows the first sequence. All the moves for white are forced. Such long forcing sequences are typical in gomoku, and expert players can read out forcing sequences of 20 to 40 moves rapidly and accurately.
